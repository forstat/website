<p>We have just published a new review on Y and mtDNA interpretation (open access):
“<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/8/1209">Assessing the Forensic Value of DNA Evidence from Y Chromosomes and Mitogenomes</a>”.
(It is a part of the Special Issue “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes/special_issues/Advances_Forensic_Genetics">Advances in Forensic Genetics</a>” of <em><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes/s">Genes</a></em>).</p>
<p>We review the scientific issues, the many interpretation approaches that have been proposed, and point out deficiencies. We think the problems we identify are soluble, and that there will continue to be more than one acceptable approach. The key aspects that have to be addressed by the method chosen are the mutation rate of the profile, relatedness (perhaps distant) of alleged and alternative sources and the inadequacies of databases (beyond just sample size).</p>
