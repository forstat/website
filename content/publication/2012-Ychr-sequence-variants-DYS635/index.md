abstract: "We have sequenced 22 alleles of DYS635 with repeat number 22 or 23. Investigations were made to determine if sequence variants could explain the poor linear fit between parent allele heights and stutter peak heights of these two alleles. Alleles with high stutter rates were found to have longer uninterrupted stretches of repetitive units compared to alleles with a low stutter rate."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
